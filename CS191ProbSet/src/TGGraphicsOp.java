 * TGGraphicsOp is an interface that a class implements when

 * TGGraphicsOp objects are queued to be performed by TGCanvas.
 * Think of them as messages/requests sent from the Logo interpreter
 * to TGCanvas.
 * <p>
 * As examples, queueing a TGLineOp is a request to draw a line on
 * a provided Image, queueing a TGLabelOp is a request to draw a
 * String on a provided Image.

/**
 * TGKeyHandler is an interface that a class implements when it
 * would like to receive Java AWT key events from TGCanvas. The
 * provided methods are an attempt to reduce the complexity of
 * the, more general, KeyListener interface methods.
 * <p>
 * In the case of TG, TGDriver registers with TGCanvas, passing
 * the events on to the current jLogo program, invoking specific
 * user-defined procedures if they exist.
 * <p>
 * In the case of TurtleGraphicsWindow, the methods in this
 * interface are stubs that should be overridden by child classes
 * if they want to handle keyboard key events.
 * <P>

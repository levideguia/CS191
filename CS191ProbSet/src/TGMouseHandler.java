/**
 * TGMouseHandler is an interface that a class implements when
 * it would like to receive Java AWT mouse events from TGCanvas.
 * The provided methods are an attempt to reduce the complexity
 * of the, more general, MouseListener and MouseMotionListener
 * interfaces.
 * <p>
 * In the case of TG, TGDriver registers with TGCanvas, passing
 * the events on to the current jLogo program, invoking specific
 * user-defined procedures if they exist.
 * <p>
 * In the case of TurtleGraphicsWindow, the methods in this
 * interface are stubs that should be overridden by child classes
 * if they want to handle mouse input events.
 * <p>
